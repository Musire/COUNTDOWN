## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days)
- **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle

## My process

I approached the project by starting a Vite-React application and installing TailwindCSS as well as filling out the proper configurations needed for the project (extended theme colors, viewport-sizes and classes). The next step was to create the overall layout of the project from a mobile-first mindset and expanded to desktop sizes for responsiveness. Afterwards I focused on creating the effect animation keyframes and creating a custom hook to handle the time-trigger functions and countdown functions. Finally adjusting the final sizes of the components for the viewports and hoverstates of the socialmedia links.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [TailwindCss](https://tailwindcss.com/) - utility-first CSS framework

### Continued development

I would like to focus on triggering animation on a specified intervals and clean up functions of these effects for my future projects.
